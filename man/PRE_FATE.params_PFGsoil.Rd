\title{Create \emph{SOIL} parameter files for a \code{FATE-HD}
simulation}
\usage{
PRE_FATE.params_PFGsoil(name.simulation, mat.PFG.soil,
  mat.PFG.tol = NULL, opt.folder.name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name.simulation}{a \code{string} that corresponds to the main
directory or simulation name of the \code{FATE-HD} simulation}

\item{mat.PFG.soil}{a \code{data.frame} with 5 columns : PFG, type,
soil_contrib, soil_tol_min, soil_tol_max}

\item{mat.PFG.tol}{a \code{data.frame} with 5 columns : PFG, lifeStage,
soilResources, soil_tol}

\item{opt.folder.name}{(\emph{optional}) \cr a \code{string} that
corresponds to the name of the folder that will be created into the 
\code{name.simulation/DATA/PFGS/SOIL/} directory to store the results}
}
\value{
A \code{.txt} file per PFG into the 
\code{name.simulation/DATA/PFGS/SOIL/} directory with the following 
parameters :

\itemize{
  \item NAME : name of the PFG
  \item SOIL_CONTRIB : the contribution (influence) of the PFG on the
  nitrogen soil value of the pixel
  \item SOIL_LOW : the lower value of nitrogen supported by the PFG
  \item SOIL_HIGH : the upper value of nitrogen supported by the PFG
  \item ACTIVE_GERM : the germination rates depending on soil conditions
  \cr \emph{(0: 0\% 1: 10\% 2: 20\% 3: 30\% 4: 40\% 5: 50\% 6: 60\% 7: 70\% 
  8: 80\% 9: 90\% 10: 100\%)}
  \item SOIL_TOL : the PFG soil tolerance table (in a single row). \cr 
  This is a vector of 9 numbers corresponding to the ability of the PFG to
  survive or not :
  \itemize{
    \item at different life stages \emph{(Germinant (Ge), Immature (Im), 
    Mature (Ma))}
    \item under different soil conditions \emph{(Low (L), Medium (M) or 
    High (H))}.
  }
  These parameters should be given in this order : GeL, GeM, GeH, ImL, ImM,
  ImH, MaL, MaM, MaH.
  \cr \emph{(0: 0\% 1: 10\% 2: 20\% 3: 30\% 4: 40\% 5: 50\% 6: 60\% 7: 70\% 
  8: 80\% 9: 90\% 10: 100\%)}
}

A \code{SOIL_COMPLETE_TABLE.csv} file summarizing information for all groups
into the \code{name.simulation/DATA/PFGS/} directory.

If the \code{opt.folder.name} has been used, the files will be into the folder
\code{name.simulation/DATA/PFGS/SOIL/opt.folder.name/}
}
\description{
This script is designed to create parameter files containing 
soil contribution and tolerance for each PFG (one file for each of them) 
used in the soil module of \code{FATE-HD}.
}
\details{
The soil module allows the user to simulate a primary vegetation succession 
based on soil competition. \cr

Several parameters, given within \code{mat.PFG.soil}, are required for each
PFG in order to set up the soil competition :

\describe{
  \item{type}{or life-form, based on Raunkier. It should be either \code{H} 
  (herbaceous), \code{C} (chamaephyte) or \code{P} (phanerophyte) for now}
  \item{soil_contrib}{a value between 0 and X corresponding to the nitrogen 
  value of the PFG (e.g. from Ellenberg)}
  \item{soil_tol_min}{the minimum nitrogen value tolerated by the PFG}
  \item{soil_tol_max}{the maximum nitrogen value tolerated by the PFG}
}


These values will allow to calculate or define a set of characteristics for 
each PFG :

\describe{
  \item{SOIL_CONTRIB}{nitrogen contribution to the soil value of the PFG}
  \item{SOIL_LOW}{minimum nitrogen value tolerated by the PFG}
  \item{SOIL_HIGH}{maximum nitrogen value tolerated by the PFG}
  \item{ACTIVE_GERM}{proportion of seeds that will germinate for each soil
  condition (Low, Medium, High) :
  \itemize{
    \item woody species have little variation in germination rate : 90\% for
    Low and High conditions, 100\% for Medium condition
    \item herbaceous germinate less in richer soil : 80\% for Low, 100\% for
    Medium and 50\% for High conditions
  }
  }
}

A second file, \code{mat.PFG.tol}, can be given to define the importance of
the response of each PFG to each soil condition :

\describe{
  \item{PFG}{the name of the PFG concerned}
  \item{lifeStage}{the concerned life stage (Germinant, Immature, Mature)}
  \item{soilResources}{the concerned soil condition (Low, Medium, High)}
  \item{soil_tol}{the proportion of surviving individuals}
}

If these values are not given by the user, default rules are defined below :

\describe{
  \item{SOIL_TOL}{ defined for each life stage (Germinant, Immature, 
  Mature) and each soil condition (Low, Medium, High) :
  \itemize{
    \item (A) germinants are severely impacted by wrong soil conditions :
    \itemize{
      \item only 10\% of the cohorts survive in Low soil condition
      \item all cohorts die in High soil condition
    }
    \item (B) immatures are half impacted by wrong soil conditions :
    \itemize{
      \item 50\% of the cohorts survive in Low soil condition
      \item 40\% of the cohorts survive in High soil condition
    }
    \item (C) matures are little affected by wrong soil conditions :
    \itemize{
      \item 90\% of the cohorts survive in Low soil condition
      \item 80\% of the cohorts survive in High soil condition
    }
  }
  }
}
}

\title{Create maps of both Habitat suitability and simulated occurrences of 
each Plant Functional Group \cr for one (or several) specific year of a 
\code{FATE-HD} simulation}
\usage{
POST_FATE.graphic_mapPFGvsHS(name.simulation, file.simulParam = NULL,
  year, opt.no_CPU = 1, opt.strata = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{name.simulation}{a \code{string} that corresponds to the main 
directory or simulation name of the \code{FATE-HD} simulation}

\item{file.simulParam}{a \code{string} that corresponds to the name of a 
parameter file that will be contained into the \code{PARAM_SIMUL} folder 
of the \code{FATE-HD} simulation}

\item{year}{an \code{integer} corresponding to the simulation year(s) that 
will be used to extract PFG binary maps}

\item{opt.no_CPU}{default \code{1} (\emph{optional}). The number of 
resources that can be used to parallelize the \code{unzip/zip} of raster 
files}

\item{opt.strata}{default \code{ALL} (\emph{optional}). The stratum number 
from which to extract PFG binary maps}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing one or several (one for each simulation 
year) \code{list} of \code{ggplot2} objects, representing for each Plant 
Functional Group the map of modelled presence / absence vs the Habitat 
Suitability map. \cr \cr


One \code{POST_FATE_[...].pdf} file is created : 
\describe{
  \item{\file{GRAPHIC_B \cr map_PFGvsHS}}{to visualize the PFG presence 
  within the studied area (probability and simulated occurrence)}
}
}
\description{
This script is designed to produce raster maps of PFG habitat 
suitability and simulated occurrences for one (or several) specific 
\code{FATE-HD} simulation year.
}
\details{
This function allows one to obtain, for a specific \code{FATE-HD} 
simulation and a specific parameter file within this simulation, one 
preanalytical graphic. \cr \cr

For each PFG and each selected simulation year, raster maps are retrieved 
from the results folder \code{BIN_perPFG_allStrata} (unless the 
\code{opt.strata} is used, then it will be from the folder 
\code{BIN_perPFG_perStrata}) and unzipped. 
Informations extracted lead to the production of one graphic before the 
maps are compressed again :

\itemize{
  \item{the maps of \strong{Plant Functional Group habitat suitability and 
  occurrences} for each selected simulation year(s), representing the 
  probability of presence of each PFG in each pixel compared to its 
  simulated presence \cr \cr
  }
}

It requires that the \code{\link{POST_FATE.relativeAbund}} and 
\code{\link{POST_FATE.graphic_validationStatistics}} functions have 
been run and that the folders \code{BIN_perPFG_allStrata} and 
\code{BIN_perPFG_perStrata} exist.

\title{Create a graphical representation of the evolution of soil
resources through time for 5 (or more) pixels of a \code{FATE-HD} simulation}
\usage{
POST_FATE.graphic_evolutionSoil_pixels(name.simulation,
  file.simulParam = NULL, no.years = 10, opt.no_CPU = 1,
  opt.cells_ID = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name.simulation}{a \code{string} that corresponds to the main
directory or simulation name of the \code{FATE-HD} simulation}

\item{file.simulParam}{a \code{string} that corresponds to the name of a
parameter file that will be contained into the \code{PARAM_SIMUL} folder
of the \code{FATE-HD} simulation}

\item{no.years}{an \code{integer} corresponding to the number of simulation
years that will be used to extract PFG abundance maps}

\item{opt.no_CPU}{default 1 (\emph{optional}). The number of resources that 
can be used to parallelize the \code{unzip/zip} of raster files}

\item{opt.cells_ID}{default NULL (\emph{optional}). The cells ID of the 
studied area for which soil resources will be extracted.}
}
\value{
One \code{POST_FATE_[...].pdf} file is created : 
\describe{
  \item{\file{GRAPHIC_A \cr soil resources}}{to visualize 
  the evolution of its soil resource within each selected pixel through
  simulation time}
}
}
\description{
This script is designed to produce one graphical representation
for a \code{FATE-HD} simulation : the evolution through time of the soil
resources for 5 (or more) randomly selected cells of the studied area.
}
\details{
This function allows one to obtain, for a specific \code{FATE-HD} simulation
and a specific parameter file within this simulation, one preanalytical
graphics. \cr

For each stratum and each selected simulation year, raster maps are
retrieved from the results folder \code{SOIL} and unzipped.
Informations extracted lead to the production of one graphic before the
maps are compressed again :

\itemize{
  \item{the evolution of \strong{soil resources} through
  simulation time, within 5 (or more) randomly selected pixels
  of the studied area
  }
}
}
